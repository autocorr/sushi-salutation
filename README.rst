Sushi Salutations!
==================
Why hello there california-roll-compatriots and aji-aesthetes.  This is a small
module written to make alliterative salutations for, among other things, sushi
related emails. The glossary at eatsushi.com was helpful in gathering a large
number of terms. Contributions are welcome, please add more phrases if they
come to mind -- GitHub's interface makes it quite easy to edit the files in the
browser.
